# Dating matches library (Java)

## Notes
- This library provides matches for users based on criteria of Gender, Age, and Interest
- This is crude implementation without persistence
- Dummy users are present in test resource directory - [users.json](src/test/resources/users.json)
- For accuracy of implementation validate reports generated by test run

## Algorithm and design
- Created a score for each user based on source user and scores
- Sorting done based upon score

## Test Running
 - On masOS or *nix `./gralew test`
